This organization holds the open source software cobbled together by the folks at **Random-Host.tv**.

Most of these projects were born out of a specific requirement for that website, but they might be useful for others as well.

For this reason, we decided to make them open source.

**âš  Please Note:**  
These projects are tailored to our own requirements and might not be very useful as they are. They can however be used as blueprints for your own projects.
